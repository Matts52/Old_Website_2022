# Personal Website

This website serves as a place to host my personal resume and portfolio of projects along with an excuse to learn web development to a deeper extent than previously along with learning the useful framework Vue. The site's design takes major inspiration from the wonderful code found at [ayushman-git](https://github.com/ayushman-git/portfolio/tree/master/src/components) while also taking some creative liberties of my own. For the deployment of Vue websites to Github pages, the great resource at [tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/deploy-vue-app-to-github-pages-2ada48d7397e) was leaned on. I hope over time I am able to mold this project even more so to my own style and make it truly my own.

To run the project you must use the command "$ npm run serve" and locate the local port being used.
